## Design Decisions

### Architecture

- **Vue 3 Composition API**: For cleaner component logic
- **Pinia**: State management for jobs data
- **Vue Router**: Navigation between views
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive layout and styling
- **Vite**: Fast development build tool

### Key Implementation Choices

1. **Filter System**:

   - Client-side filtering for simplicity
   - URL-encoded state for shareable filters

2. **Form Handling**:

   - Reusable `FormField` component
   - Client-side validation
   - Success modal feedback

3. **Responsive Considerations**:

   - Collapsible filters on mobile
   - Card-based layout adapts to screen size
   - Mobile-first pagination

4. **Performance**:
   - Paginated job listings
   - Computed properties for efficient filtering
   - Lazy-loaded components
